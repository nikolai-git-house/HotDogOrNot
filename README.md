# Hotdog or Not

This is a small app demonstrating how to use CoreML with Xamarin to build an image detection app. ARKit is used to preview the camera and Vision is used to execute the model.

The model it uses was trained with [Microsoft's Custom Vision service](https://www.customvision.ai).

All the interesting code is in [ViewController.cs](HotDogOrNot/ViewController.cs).
